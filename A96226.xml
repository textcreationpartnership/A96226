            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>All which are given by inſpiration of God, to be the Rule of Faith and Life.</p>
               <p>III. The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inſpiration, are no part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Scripture; and therefore are of no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church of God, nor to be any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe approved, or made uſe of, than other humane Writings.</p>
               <p>IV. The Authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be beleeved and obeyed, dependeth not upon the Teſtimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is Truth it ſelfe) the Author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, becauſe it is the Word of God.</p>
               <p>V. We may be moved and induced by the Teſtimony of the Church to an high and reverent eſteeme of the holy Scripture. And the heavenlineſſe of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the majeſty of the Style, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the Parts, the Scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God,) the full diſcovery it makes of the only way of mans ſalvation, the many other incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Excellencies, and the intire perfection thereof,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113941:4"/> are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it ſelf to be the Word of God: yet notwithſtanding, our full perſuaſion and aſſurance of the infallible truth, and Divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witneſſe by and with the Word, in our hearts.</p>
               <p>VI. The whole Councel of God concerning all things neceſſary for his own Glory, mans ſalvation, Faith, and Life, is either expreſſely ſetdown in Scripture, or by good and neceſſary conſequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or Traditions of men. Nevertheleſſe we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be neceſſary for the ſaving underſtanding of ſuch things as are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word: and that there are ſome circumſtances concerning the Worſhip of God, and Government of the Church, common to human actions and Societies, which are to be ordered by the Light of Nature and Chriſtian Prudence, according to the generall Rules of the Word, which are alwayes to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plaine in themſelves, nor alike cleare unto all: yet thoſe things which are neceſſary to be known, beleeved, and obſerved for ſalvation, are ſo clearly propounded and opened in ſome place of Scripture or other, that not only the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the unlearned, in a due uſe of the ordinary means, may attain unto a ſufficient underſtanding of them.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Old Teſtament in Hebrew (which was the Native Language of the people of God of old,)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113941:5"/> and the New Teſtament in Greek, (which at the time of the writing of it was moſt generally known to the Nations) being immediatly inſpired by God, and by his ſingular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Authenticall; ſo as, in all Controverſies of Religion, the Church is finally to Appeale unto them. But, becauſe theſe Originall Tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and intereſt in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the feare of God, to read and ſearch them, therefore they are to be tranſlated into the vulgar Language of every Nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in an acceptable manner; and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.</p>
               <p>IX. The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the Scripture it ſelfe: and therefore, when there is a Queſtion about the true and full ſenſe of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it muſt be ſearched and known by other places that ſpeak more clearly.</p>
               <p>X. The Supreme Judge by which all Controverſies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councels, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines of men, and private ſpirits, are to be examined; and, in whoſe Sentence we are to reſt; can be no other but the Holy Spirit ſpeaking in the Scripture.</p>

               <p>THere is but one only, living, and true God: who is infinite in Being and Perfection, a moſt pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, inviſible, without body, parts, or paſſions, immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, immenſe, eternall, incomprehenſible, almighty, moſt wiſe, moſt holy, moſt free, moſt abſolute, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things according to the Counſell of his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and moſt righteous will, for his own glory; moſt loving, gracious, mercifull, long-ſuffering, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſſe and truth, forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſin; the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him; and withall, moſt juſt and terrible in his judgements, hating all ſin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.</p>
               <p>II. God hath all life, glory, goodneſſe, bleſſedneſſe, in, and of himſelf; and is alone in, and unto himſelf all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, notſtanding in need of any creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any Glory from them, but only manifeſting his own Glory, in, by, unto, and upon them: He is the alone Fountain of all Being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and, hath moſt Soveraigne Dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatſoever himſelf pleaſeth. In his ſight all things are open and manifeſt; his knowledg is infinite, infallible, &amp; independent upon the creature, ſo as nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain. He is moſt holy in all his counſels, in all his works, and in all his commands. To him is due from Angels and men,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113941:6"/> and every other creature, whatſoever worſhip, ſervice, or obedience he is pleaſed to require of them.</p>
               <p>III. In the Unity of the God-head there be Three Perſons, of one ſubſtance, power, and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt. The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Son is eternally begotten of the Father: the Holy Ghoſt eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Gods Eternall Decree.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>GOd from all eternity did, by the moſt wiſe and holy Counſell of his own Will, freely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably ordaine whatſoever comes to paſſe: yet ſo as thereby neither is God the Author of ſin, nor is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to the will of the Creatures, nor is the Liberty or contingencie of ſecond Cauſes taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>II. Although God knows whatſoever may, or can come to paſſe upon all ſuppoſed conditions, yet hath he not decreed any thing becauſe he foreſaw it as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or as that which would come to paſſe upon ſuch conditions.</p>
               <p>III. By the Decree of God, for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his glory, ſome men and Angels are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113941:6"/> unto everlaſting life, and others fore-ordained to everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>IV. Theſe Angels and men thus predeſtinated and fore-ordained, are particularly, and unchangeably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and their number is ſo certain, and definite, that it cannot be either increaſed, or diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>V. Thoſe of man-kinde that are predeſtinated unto Life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternall and immutable purpoſe, and the ſecret Counſel and good pleaſure of his Will, hath choſen, in Chriſt, unto everlaſting glory, out of his meer free grace and love, without any fore-ſight of Faith, or Good-works, or perſeverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or cauſes moving him thereunto: and all, to the praiſe of his glorious grace.</p>
               <p>VI. As God hath appointed the Elect unto glory; ſo hath he, by the eternall and moſt free purpoſe of his Will, fore-ordained all the means thereunto. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Chriſt, are effectually called unto faith in Chriſt, by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, are juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, and kept by his power through faith unto ſalvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Chriſt, effectually called, juſtified, adopted, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved; but the Elect only.</p>
               <p>VII. The reſt of man-kinde God was pleaſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the unſearchable counſell of his own Will,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113941:7"/> whereby he extendeth, or with-holdeth mercy, as he pleaſeth, for the glory of his Soveraigne Power over his creatures, to paſſe by; and, to ordain them to diſhonour and wrath, for their ſin, to the praiſe of his glorious ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Doctrine of this high Myſtery of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is to be handled with ſpeciall prudence and care, that men attending the Will of God revealed in his Word, and yeelding obedience thereunto, may, from the certainty of their effectuall Vocation, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their eternall Election. So ſhall this Doctrine afford matter of praiſe, reverence, and admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that ſincerely obey the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>II. After God had made all other creatures, he created man, male and female, with reaſonable and immortall ſouls, indued with knowledge, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true holineſſe, after his own Image; having

               <p>GOd the great Creator of all things doth uphold, direct, diſpoſe, and governe all creatures, actions, and things, from the greateſt even to the leaſt, by his moſt wiſe and holy Providence, according to his infallible fore-knowledge, and the free, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table counſell of his own Will, to the praiſe of the glory of his wiſedome, power, juſtice, goodneſſe, and mercy.</p>
               <p>II. Although, in relation to the fore-knowledge and decree of God, the firſt Cauſe, all things come to paſſe immutably, and infallibly: yet, by the ſame Providence, hee ordereth them to fall out, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of ſecond cauſes, either neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, freely, or contingently.</p>
               <p>III. God, in his ordinary Providence maketh uſe of meanes, yet is free to work without, above, and againſt them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:113941:8"/>
               <p> IV. The almighty power, unſearchable wiſedome, and infinite goodneſſe of God ſo farre manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his Providence, that it extendeth it ſelfe even to the firſt Fall, and all other ſinnes of Angels and Men; and that not by a bare permiſſion, but ſuch as hath joyned with it a moſt wiſe and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bounding, and otherwiſe ordering, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, in a manifold diſpenſation, to his owne holy ends: yet ſo, as the ſinfulneſſe thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth onely from the creature, and not from God, who being moſt holy and righteous, neither is, nor can be the Author or Approver of ſin.</p>
               <p>V. The moſt wiſe, righteous, and gracious God doth oftentimes leave for a ſeaſon his owne children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chaſtiſe them for their former ſinnes, or to diſcover unto them the hidden ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and deceitfulneſſe of their hearts, that they may be humbled; and, to raiſe them to a more cloſe and conſtant dependance for their ſupport upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make them more watchfull againſt all future occaſions of ſin, and for ſundry other juſt and holy ends.</p>
               <p>VI. As for thoſe wicked and ungodly men whom God, as a righteous judge, for former ſinnes doth blinde and harden, from them he not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth his grace, whereby they might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened in their underſtandings, and wrought upon in their hearts; but, ſometimes alſo withdraweth the gifts which they had, and expoſeth them to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as their corruption makes occaſions of ſin; and withall, gives them over to their own luſts, the

               <p>VII. As the providence of God doth in generall, reach to all Creatures; ſo after a moſt ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it taketh care of his Church, and diſpoſeth all things to the good thereof.</p>

               <p>OUr firſt Parents being ſeduced by the ſubtilty and temptation of Satan, ſinned, in eating the forbidden fruit. This their ſin, God was pleaſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiſeand holy counſell to permit, having purpoſed to order it to his own glory.</p>
               <p>II. By this ſin they fell from their originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and communion with God, and ſo became dead in ſin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>III. They being the root of all man-kinde, the guilt of this ſin was imputed, and the ſame death in ſin and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their poſterity deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from them by ordinary generation.</p>

Every-ſin, both Originall and Actuall, being a tranſgreſſion of the righteous Law of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, doth, in its own nature, bring guilt upon the ſinner; whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curſe of the Law, and ſo made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death, with all miſeries ſpirituall, temporall, and eternall.</p>

               <p>THe diſtance between God and the Creature is ſo great, that although reaſonable Creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their Bleſſedneſſe and Reward, but by ſome voluntary condeſcenſion on Gods part, which he hath been pleaſed to expreſſe by way of Covenant.</p>
               <p>II. The firſt Covenant made with Man, was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, wherein Life was promiſed to Adam, and in him to his Poſterity, upon condition of perfect and perſonall obedience.</p>
               <p>III. Man, by his Fall having made himſelf unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Life by that Covenant, the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make a Second, commonly called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113941:9"/> of Grace; Wherein he freely offereth unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, requiring of them Faith in Him that they may be ſaved, and promiſing to give unto all thoſe that are ordained unto Life, his holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to beleeve.</p>
               <p>IV. This Covenant of Grace is frequently ſet forth in Scripture by the name of a Teſtament, in reference to the death of Jeſus Chriſt the Teſtator, and to the everlaſting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.</p>
               <p>V. This Covenant was differently adminiſtred in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel: Under the Law, it was adminiſtred by Promiſes, Prophecies, Sacrifices, Circumciſion, the Paſchal Lamb, and other Types and Ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all fore-ſignifying Chriſt to come: which were, for that time, ſufficient and efficacious, through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit, to inſtruct and build up the Elect in Faith in the Promiſed Meſſiah, by whom they had full remiſſion of ſins, and eternall Salvation: and is called, the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>VI. Under the Goſpel, when Chriſt, the ſubſtance, was exhibited, the Ordinances in which this Covenant is diſpenſed, are the Preaching of the Word, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: Which, though fewer in number, and adminiſtred with more ſimplicity, and leſſe outward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet, in them, it is held forth in more fullneſſe, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſpirituall efficacy, to all Nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and, is called the New Teſtament. There are not therefore Two Covenants of Grace, differing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113941:10"/> in ſubſtance, but one and the ſame, under various diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Chriſt the Mediator.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT pleaſed God, in His eternall purpoſe, to chooſe and ordain the Lord Jeſus, His only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and Man; the Prophet, Prieſt, and King, the Head, and Saviour of His Church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the World: Unto whom He did from all eternity give a People, to be his Seed, and to be by him in time Redeemed, Called, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, Sanctified, and Glorified.</p>
               <p>II. The Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being very and eternall God, of one Subſtance, and equall with the Father; did, when the fullneſſe of time was come, take upon Him mans nature, with all the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall properties, and common infirmities thereof, yet, without ſin: being conceived by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her ſubſtance. So that, two whole, perfect, and diſtinct Natures, the Godhead and the Manhood, were inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably joyned together in one Perſon, without Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Compoſition, or Confuſion. Which Perſon, is very God, and very Man, yet one Chriſt, the only Mediator between God and Man.</p>
               <p>III. The Lord Jeſus, in his humane nature thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the divine, was ſanctified and anointed with the holy Spirit, above meaſure, having in him all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113941:10"/> of wiſdome and knowledge; in whom, it pleaſed the Father, that all fullneſſe ſhould dwell; to the end, that being holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and full of grace and truth, he might be thorowly furniſhed to execute the Office of a Mediator, and Surety. Which Office he took not unto himſelf, but was thereunto called by his Father, who put all power and judgement into his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the ſame.</p>
               <p>IV. This Office, the Lord Jeſus did moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undertake; which that he might diſcharge, he was made under the Law, and did perfectly fullfill it, endured moſt grievous torments imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in his Soul, and moſt painfull ſufferings in his Body; was crucified, and died; was buried, and remained under the power of death; yet ſaw no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. On the third day he aroſe from the dead, with the ſame body in which he ſuffered, with which alſo he aſcended into Heaven, and there ſitteth at the right hand of his Father, making interceſſion, and ſhall return to Judge, men, and Angels, at the end of the World.</p>
               <p>V. The Lord Jeſus, by his perfect obedience, and ſacrifice of himſelf, which he, through the eternall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, once offered up unto God, hath fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of his Father; and purchaſed, not only reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but an everlaſting inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, for all thoſe whom the Father hath given unto him.</p>
               <p>VI. Although the work of Redemption was not actually wrought by Chriſt till after his Incarnation, yet the vertue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto the Elect in all ages ſucceſſively from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113941:11"/> of the world, in, and by thoſe promiſes, types, and ſacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and ſignified to be the ſeed of the woman which ſhould bruiſe the ſerpents head; and the Lambe ſlain from the beginning of the world: being yeſterday, and to day the ſame, and for ever.</p>
               <p>VII. Chriſt, in the work of Mediation, acteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both Natures, by each Nature doing that which is proper to it ſelf: yet, by reaſon of the unity of the Perſon, that which is proper to one Nature, is ſometimes in Scripture attributed to the Perſon deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the other Nature.</p>
               <p>VIII. To all thoſe for whom Chriſt hath purchaſed Redemption, he doth certainly, and effectually apply, and communicate the ſame, making interceſſion for them, and revealing unto them, in, and by the Word, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſalvation, effectually perſwading them by his Spirit, to beleeve, and obey, and governing their hearts by his Word and Spirit, overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty Power and Wiſdome, in ſuch manner, and wayes, as are moſt conſonant to his wonderfull and unſearchable diſpenſation.</p>

               <p>GOD hath indued the Will of man with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any abſolute neceſſity of nature determined to good or evil.</p>
               <p>II. Man, in his ſtate of Innocency, had freedom, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113941:11"/> power, to will, and to doe that which was good, and well pleaſing to God; but yet, mutably, ſo that he might fall from it.</p>
               <p>III. Man by his fall into a ſtate of ſin, hath wholly loſt all ability of Will to any ſpirituall good accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying ſalvation: ſo as, a naturall man, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together averſe from that good, and dead in ſin, is not able, by his own ſtrength, to convert himſelf, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf thereunto.</p>
               <p>IV. When God converts a ſinner, and tranſlates him into the ſtate of grace, he freeth him from his naturall bondage under ſin; and, by his grace alone, inables him freely to will, and to do that which is ſpiritually good; yet ſo, as that by reaſon of his remaining corruption, he doth not, perfectly, nor only, will that which is good, but doth alſo will that which is evil.</p>
               <p>V. The will of man is made, perfectly, and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably free to good alone, in the ſtate of Glory only.</p>

This effectuall Call is of Gods free, and ſpeciall grace alone, not from any thing at all foreſeen in man, who is altogether paſſive therein, untill being quickned and renewed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby inabled to anſwer this Call, and to imbrace the grace offered, and conveyed in it.</p>

               <p>II.

               <p>III. Chriſt by his obedience, and death, did fully diſcharge the debt of all thoſe that are thus juſtified, and did make a proper, reall, and full ſatisfaction to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Juſtice in their behalf. Yet, in as much as he was given by the Father, for them; and, his obedience and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction accepted in their ſtead; and, both, freely, not for any thing in them; their Juſtification is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of free grace; that, both the exact juſtice, and rich grace of God, might be glorified in the juſtification of ſinners.</p>
               <p>IV. God did, from all eternity, decree to juſtifie all the elect, and Chriſt did, in the fullneſſe of time, die for their ſins, and riſe again for their juſtification: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they are not juſtified, untill the holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Chriſt unto them.</p>

               <p>THe grace of Faith, whereby the elect are inabled to beleeve to the ſaving of their ſoules, is the work of the Spirit of Chriſt in their hearts; and is ordinarily wrought by the Miniſtry of the Word: by which alſo, and by the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and prayer, it is increaſed and ſtrengthened.</p>
               <p>II. By this Faith, a Chriſtian beleeveth to be true, whatſoever is revealed in the Word, for the authority of God himſelf ſpeaking therein; and, acteth differently upon that which each particular paſſage thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth; yeelding obedience to the Commands, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the threatnings, and imbracing the Promiſes of God for this life, and that which is to come. But the principall Acts of ſaving faith, are, Accepting, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Reſting upon Chriſt alone for Juſtification, Sanctification, and Eternall life, by vertue of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
               <p>III. This Faith is different in degrees, weak, or ſtrong; may be often and many waies aſſailed, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but gets the victory; growing up in many to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a full aſſurance through Chriſt, who is both the Author and finiſher of our faith.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113941:14"/> of the Goſpel, as well as that of faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>II. By it, a ſinner, out of the ſight and ſenſe not only of the danger, but alſo of the filthineſſe and odiouſneſſe of his ſins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous Law of God; and, upon the apprehenſion of his mercy in Chriſt to ſuch as are penitent, ſo grieves for, and hates his ſins, as to turn from them all unto God, purpoſing and endeavouring to walk with him in all the wayes of his Commandements.</p>
               <p>III. Although Repentance be not to be reſted in, as any ſatisfaction for ſin, or any cauſe of the pardon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is the act of Gods free grace in Chriſt; yet is it of ſuch neceſſity to all ſinners, that none may expect pardon without it.</p>
               <p>IV. As there is no ſin ſo ſmall, but it deſerves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo there is no ſin ſo great, that it can bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon thoſe who truly repent.</p>
               <p>V. Men ought not to content themſelves with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall repentance, but it is every mans duty to endeavour to repent of his particular ſins, particularly.</p>
               <p>VI. As every man is bound to make private confeſſion of his ſins to God, praying for the pardon thereof; upon which, and the forſaking of them, he ſhall finde mercy: ſo, he that ſcandalizeth his Brother, or the Church of Chriſt, ought to be willing by a private or publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſorrow for his ſin, to declare his repentance to thoſe that are offended, who are thereupon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him, and in love to receive him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of Good Works.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>GOod Works are only ſuch as God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his holy Word, and not ſuch as, without the warrant thereof, are deviſed by men, out of blinde zeal, or upon any pretence of good intention.</p>
               <p>II. Theſe good works, done in obedience to Gods Commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith: and, by them, Beleevers manifeſt their thankfullneſſe, ſtrengthen their aſſurance, edifie their Brethren, adorn the profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſtop the mouthes of the adverſaries, and glorifie God, whoſe workmanſhip they are, created in Chriſt Jeſus thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; that, having their fruit unto holineſſe, they may have the end, eternall life.</p>
               <p>III. Their ability to doe good works, is not at all of themſelves, but wholly from the Spirit of Chriſt. And that they may be inabled thereunto, beſides the graces they have already received, there is required an actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſame holy Spirit, to work in them to will and to doe, of his good pleaſure: yet are they not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unleſſe, upon a ſpeciall motion of the Spirit; but, they ought to be diligent in ſtirring up the grace of God that is in them.</p>
               <p>IV. They, who in their obedience, attain to the greateſt height, which is poſſible in this life, are ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſupererogate, and to doe more than God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as that they fall ſhort of much which in duty they are bound to doe.</p>
               <p>V. We cannot, by our beſt Works, merit pardon of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113941:15"/> ſin, or eternall life at the hand of God, by reaſon of the great diſproportion that is between them and the glory to come; and, the infinite diſtance that is between us and God, whom, by them, we can neither profit, nor ſatisfie for the debt of our former ſins, but, when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants; and, becauſe, as they are good, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his Spirit; and, as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with ſo much weakneſſe and imperfection, that they cannot endure the ſeverity of Gods judgement.</p>
               <p>VI. Yet notwithſtanding, the perſons of Beleevers being accepted through Chriſt, their good workes alſo are accepted in him, not as though they were in this life wholy unblameable and unreproveable in Gods ſight; but that, he looking upon them in his Son, is pleaſed to accept, and reward that which is ſincere, although accompanied with many weakneſſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
               <p>VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good uſe both to themſelves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet, becauſe they proceed not from an heart puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith; nor are done in a right manner, according to the Word; nor, to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore ſinfull, and cannot pleaſe God, or make a man meet to receive grace from God. And yet, their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them is more ſinfull, and diſpleaſing unto God.</p>

               <p>THey, whom God hath accepted in his Beloved, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, and ſanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally, nor finally, fall away from the ſtate of Grace: but ſhall certainly perſevere therein to the end, and be eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p>II. This Perſeverance of the Saints, depends not upon their own free-will, but upon the immutability of the Decree of Election flowing from the free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love of God the Father; upon the efficacy of the merit, and interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; the abiding of the Spirit, and of the ſeed of God within them; and the nature of the Covenant of Grace: from all which, ariſeth alſo the certainty, and infallibility thereof.</p>
               <p>III. Nevertheleſſe, they may, through the temptations of Satan and of the World, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preſervation, fall into grievous ſins; and, for a time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein: whereby they incurre Gods diſpleaſure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to be deprived of ſome meaſure of their graces and comforts, have their hearts hardned, and their conſciences wounded, hurt, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize others, and bring temporall judgements upon themſelves.</p>

               <p>ALthough hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themſelves with falſe hopes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113941:16"/> and carnall preſumptions of being in the favour of God, and eſtate of ſalvation; which hope of theirs ſhall periſh: yet, ſuch as truly beleeve in the Lord Jeſus, and love him in ſincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before him, may, in this life, be certainly aſſured that they are in the ſtate of grace, and may rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, which hope ſhall never make them aſhamed.</p>
               <p>II. This certainty is not a bare conjecturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable perſwaſion, grounded upon a fallible hope; but, an infallible aſſurance of faith, founded, upon the divine truth of the promiſes of ſalvation, the inward evidence of thoſe graces unto which theſe promiſes are made, the teſtimony of the Spirit of Adoption witneſſing with our ſpirits that we are the children of God: which Spirit is the earneſt of our inheritance, whereby we are ſealed to the day of redemption.</p>
               <p>III. This infallible aſſurance doth not ſo belong to the eſſence of faith, but that a true beleever may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it: yet, being inabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right uſe of ordinary meanes, attain thereunto. And therefore it is the duty of every one, to give all diligence to make his calling and election ſure; that thereby his heart may be inlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt, in love and thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God, and in ſtrength and chearfullneſſe in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this aſſurance: ſo farre is it, from inclining men to looſeneſſe.</p>
               <p>IV. True beleevers may have the aſſurance of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation divers wayes ſhaken, diminiſhed, and intermitted; as, by negligence in preſerving of it, by falling into
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113941:17"/> ſome ſpeciall ſin, which woundeth the conſcience, and grieveth the ſpirit; by, ſome ſudden, or vehement tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Gods withdrawing the light of his countenance, and ſuffering even ſuch as fear him to walk in darkneſſe and to have no light: yet are they never utterly deſtitute of that ſeed of God, and life of faith, that love of Chriſt and the brethren, that ſincerity of heart, and conſcience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this Aſſurance may, in due time, be revived; and by the which, in the mean time, they are ſupported from utter deſpair.</p>

               </head>
               <p>GOD gave to Adam a Law, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him, and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to perſonall, entire, exact, and perpetuall obedience; promiſed life upon the fullfilling, and threatned death upon the breach of it: and indued him with power and ability to keep it.</p>
               <p>II. This Law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of righteouſneſſe, and, as ſuch, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten Commandments, and written in two Tables: the four firſt Commandments containing our duty towards God; and the other ſix, our duty to man.</p>
               <p>III. Beſide this Law, commonly called Moral, God was pleaſed to give to the people of Iſrael, as a Church under age, Ceremoniall Laws containing ſeverall typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinances, partly of worſhip, prefiguring Chriſt, his graces, actions, ſufferings, and benefits; and partly, holding forth divers inſtructions of moral duties. All
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113941:17"/> which Ceremonial Laws are now abrogated, under the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>IV. To them alſo, as a Body Politique, he gave ſundry Judicial Laws, which expired together with the State of that People; not obliging any other now, further than the general equity thereof may require.</p>
               <p>V. The Moral Law doth for ever binde all, as well juſtified perſons as others, to the obedience thereof; and that, not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but alſo in reſpect of the authority of God the Creatour, who gave it: Neither doth Chriſt, in the Goſpel, any way diſſolve, but much ſtrengthen this obligation.</p>
               <p>VI. Although true Beleevers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, to be thereby juſtified, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; yet, is it of great uſe to them, as well as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in that, as a Rule of life informing them of the will of God, and their duty, it directs, and bindes them to walke accordingly; diſcovering alſo the ſinfull pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their nature, hearts, and lives; ſo as, examining themſelves thereby, they may come to further convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of, humiliation for, and hatred againſt ſin; together with a cleerer fight of the need they have of Chriſt, and the perfection of his obedience. It is likewiſe of uſe to the Regenerate, to reſtrain their corruptions, in that it forbids ſin: and, the threatnings of it ſerve to ſhew, what, even their ſins, deſerve; and, what afflictions, in this life, they may expect for them, although freed from the curſe thereof threatned in the Law. The Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, in like manner, ſhew them Gods approbation of obedience, and what bleſſings they may expect upon the performance thereof; although, not as due to them by the Law, as a Covenant of Works. So as, a mans doing good, and refraining from evil, becauſe the Law
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113941:18"/> encourageth to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the Law; and, not under grace.</p>
               <p>VII. Neither are the forementioned Uſes of the Law contrary to the grace of the Goſpel, but do ſweetly comply with it; the Spirit of Chriſt ſubduing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the will of man, to do that, freely and chearfully, which the will of God, revealed in the Law, requireth to be done.</p>

All which, were common alſo to Beleevers under the Law. But, under the New Teſtament, the liberty of Chriſtians is further inlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, to which the Jewiſh Church was ſubjected; and in greater boldneſſe of acceſſe to the Throne of Grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than Beleevers, under the Law, did ordinarily partake of.</p>

               <p>II. Religious Worſhip is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and to him alone; not, to Angels, Saints, or any other Creature: and, ſince the Fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other, but of Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>III. Prayer, with Thankſgiving being one ſpecial part of Religious Worſhip, is, by God, required of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113941:19"/> all men: and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the Name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his Will, with underſtanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perſeverence; and, if vocal, in a known tongue.</p>
               <p>IV. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all ſorts of men living, or that ſhall live hereafter: but, not for the Dead, nor for thoſe of whom it may be known, that they have ſinned the ſin unto death.</p>
               <p>V. The reading of the Scriptures with godly fear; the ſound Preaching and Conſcionable Hearing of the Word, in obedience unto God, with underſtanding, faith, and reverence; ſinging of Pſalms with grace in the heart; as alſo, the due adminiſtration, and worthy receiving of the Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt; are all, parts of the ordinary Religious Worſhip of God: Beſide Religious Oathes, Vows, Solemn Faſtings, and Thankſgivings, upon ſpecial occaſions, which are, in their ſeveral times and ſeaſons, to be uſed, in an holy and religious maner.</p>
               <p>VI. Neither Prayer, nor any other part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, is now under the Goſpel, either tyed unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed: but God is to be Worſhipped every where, in Spirit and Truth; as in private Families daily, and in ſecret, each one by himſelf; ſo, more ſolemnly, in the publique Aſſemblies, which are not careleſly, or wilfully to be neglected, or forſaken, when God, by his Word or Providence, calleth thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:113941:20"/>
               <p> VII. As it is of the Law of Nature, that, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a due proportion of time be ſet apart, for the Worſhip of God; ſo, in his Word, by a poſitive, Moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all Ages, he hath particularly appointed One Day in Seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him: which, from the beginning of the World to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, was the laſt Day of the week; and, from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, was changed into the Firſt Day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lords Day, and is to be continued to the end of the World, as the Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs before hand, do not only obſerve an holy Reſt, all the Day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly imployments, and recreations, but alſo are taken up the whole time, in the publique and private Exerciſes of his Worſhip, and in the Duties of neceſſity, and mercy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of lawful Oathes and Vows.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Lawful Oath is a part of Religious Worſhip, wherein upon juſt occaſion, the perſon ſwearing, ſolemnly calleth God to witneſs what he aſſerteth, or promiſeth; and to Judge him according to the truth, or falſhood of what he ſweareth.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:113941:20"/>
               <p> II. The Name of God only, is that by which men ought to ſwear; and, therein it is to be uſed with all holy fear and reverence. Therefore, to ſwear vainly, or raſhly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; or, to ſwear at all, by any other thing, is ſinful, and to be abhorred. Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an Oath is warranted by the Word of God, under the New Teſtament, as well as under the Old; ſo, a lawful Oath, being impoſed by lawful Authority, in ſuch matters ought to be taken.</p>
               <p>III. Whoſoever taketh an Oath, ought duly to conſider the weightineſs of ſo ſolemn an act; and therein to avouch nothing, but what he is fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded is the truth. Neither may any man binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Oath to any thing but what is good and juſt, and what he believeth ſo to be, and what he is able, and reſolved to perform. Yet is it a ſin, to refuſe an Oath touching any thing that is good and juſt, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by lawful Authority.</p>
               <p>IV. An Oath is to be taken in the plain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of the words, without equivocation, or mental reſervation. It cannot oblige to ſin: but, in any thing not ſinful, being taken, it bindes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, although to a mans own hurt. Nor is it to be violated, although made to Hereticks, or Infidels.</p>
               <p>V. A Vow is of the like nature with a Promiſſory Oath, and ought to be made with the like Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care, and to be performed with the like faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:113941:21"/>
               <p> VI. It is not to be made to any Creature but to God alone: and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of Faith, and conſcience of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in way of thankfulneſs for mercy received, or for the obtaining of what we want; whereby we more ſtrictly binde our ſelves to neceſſary duties; or, to other things, ſo far, and ſo long, as they may fitly conduce thereunto.</p>
               <p>VII. No man may Vow, to do any thing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Word of God, or what would hinder any duty therein commanded; or which is not in his own power, and, for the performance whereof, he hath no promiſe of ability from God. In which reſpects, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Monaſtical Vows, of perpetual ſingle life, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Poverty, and Regular Obedience, are ſo far from being degrees of higher Perfection, that they are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and ſinful ſnares, in which, no Chriſtian may intangle himſelf.</p>

               <p>GOd, the ſupreme Lord and King of all the World, hath Ordained Civil Magiſtrates, to be, under him, over the People, for his own Glory, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good: and, to this end hath armed them with the Power of the Sword, for the defence and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of them that are good, and for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:113941:21"/>
               <p> II. It is lawful for Chriſtians to accept and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office of a Magiſtrate; when called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: in the managing whereof, as they ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to maintain Piety, Juſtice, and Peace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wholſom Laws of each Commonwealth; ſo, for that end, they may lawfully now, under the New Teſtament, wage Warre, upon juſt and neceſſary occaſion.</p>
               <p>III. The Civil Magiſtrate may not aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments, or the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: yet, he hath authority, and it is his duty, to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Unity and Peace be preſerved in the Church, that the Truth of God be kept pure, and intire; that all Blaſphemies and Hereſies be ſuppreſſed; all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and abuſes in Worſhip and Diſcipline pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or reformed; and all the Ordinances of God duly ſetled, adminiſtred, and obſerved. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effecting whereof, he hath power to call Synods, to be preſent at them, and to provide that whatſoever is tranſacted in them, be according to the minde of God.</p>
               <p>IV. It is the duty of People to pray for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to honour their Perſons, to pay them Tribute and other Dues, to obey their lawful Commands, and to be ſubject to their Authority, for conſcience ſake. Infidelity, or difference in Religion doth not make void the Magiſtrates juſt and legal Authority, nor free the People from their due obedience to him: from which, Eccleſiaſtical perſons are not exempted; much
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113941:22"/> leſs hath the Pope any Power and Juriſdiction over them, in their Dominions, or over any of their People; and, leaſt of all, to deprive them of their Dominions, or lives, if he ſhall judge them to be Hereticks, or upon any other pretence whatſoever.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MArriage is to be between one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: neither is it lawful for any Man to have more then one Wife, nor for any Woman to have more then one Husband; at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>II. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of Husband and Wife, for the increaſe of mankinde with a legitimate iſſue, and of the Church with an holy ſeed; and, for preventing of uncleanneſs.</p>
               <p>III. It is lawful for all ſorts of people to marry, who are able with judgement, to give their Conſent. Yet, is it the duty of Chriſtians to marry only in the Lord: And therefore ſuch as profeſs the true reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, ſhould not marry with Infidels, Papiſts, or other Idolaters: Neither ſhould ſuch as are godly, be unequally yoked, by marrying with ſuch as are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly wicked in their life, or maintain damnable Hereſies.</p>
               <p>IV. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113941:22"/> Conſanguinity or Affinity forbidden in the Word; No can ſuch inceſtuous marriages ever be made law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by any Law of man or conſent of Parties, ſo as thoſe perſons may live together as man and wife. The man may not marry any of his wives kindred, nearer in blood, then he may of his own; nor, the woman, of her husbands kindred, nearer in blood, then of her own.</p>
               <p>V. Adultery, or fornication committed after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, being detected before marriage, giveth juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the innocent party to diſſolve that Contract. In the caſe of Adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to ſue our a Divorce: And, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead.</p>
               <p>VI. Although the Corruption of man be ſuch as is apt to ſtudy arguments, unduely to put aſunder thoſe whom God hath joyned together in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or ſuch wilful deſertion as can no way be remedied, by the Church, or Civil Magiſtrate, is cauſe ſufficient of diſſolving the bond of marriage: Wherein, a publique, and orderly courſe of Proceeding, is to be obſerved; And, the perſons concerned in it, not left to their own wills and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in their own Caſe.</p>

               <p>THe Catholique or Univerſal Church which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, conſiſts of the whole number of the Elect, that have been, are, or ſhall be gathered into One, under Chriſt the Head thereof; and is, the Spouſe, the Body, the Fulneſs of Him that filleth all in all.</p>
               <p>II. The Viſible Church, which is alſo Catholique or Univerſal, under the Goſpel (not confined to one Nation, as before, under the Law) conſiſts of all thoſe, throughout the World, that profeſs the true Religion; and, of their Children: and is, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Houſe and Family of God, out of which, there is no ordinary poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Salvation.</p>
               <p>III. Unto this Catholique Viſible Church, Chriſt hath given the Miniſtry, Oracles, and Ordinances of God, for the gathering, and perfecting of the Saints, in this life, to the end of the World: and doth by his own preſence and Spirit, according to his promiſe, make them effectual thereunto.</p>
               <p>IV. This Catholique Church hath been ſomtimes more, ſomtimes leſs viſible. And particular Churches, which are Members thereof, are more or leſs pure, according as the Doctrine of the Goſpel is taught and imbraced, Ordinances adminiſtred, and Publique Worſhip performed more or leſs purely in them.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:113941:23"/>
               <p> V. The pureſt Churches under Heaven are ſubject both to mixture, and error: and ſome have ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, as to become no Churches of Chriſt, but Synagogues of Satan. Nevertheleſs, there ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Church on Earth, to worſhip God according to his will.</p>
               <p>VI. There is no other Head of the Church, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Nor can the Pope of Rome, in any ſenſe, be head thereof: but is, that Antichriſt, that Man of ſin, and Son of Perdition, that exalteth himſelf, in the Church, againſt Chriſt, and all that is called God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of the Communion of Saints.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALl Saints, that are united to Jeſus Chriſt their Head, by his Spirit, and by faith, have fellowſhip with him in his graces, ſufferings, death, reſurrection, and glory: And, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance of ſuch duties, publique and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.</p>
               <p>II. Saints by profeſſion, are bound to maintain an holy fellowſhip and communion in the worſhip of God, and in performing ſuch other ſpiritual ſervices as tend to their mutual edification; as alſo, in relieving
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113941:24"/> each other in outward things, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities, and neceſſities. Which Communion, as God offereth opportunity, is to be extended unto all thoſe, who, in every place, call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>III. This Communion which the Saints have with Chriſt, doth not make them, in any wiſe, partakers of the ſubſtance of his Godhead; or, to be equal with Chriſt, in any reſpect: either of which to affirm, is impious, and blaſphemous. Nor doth their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another, as Saints, take away, or infringe the title, or propriety which each man hath in his goods and poſſeſſions.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SAcraments are holy Signes, and Seales of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, immediately Inſtituted by God, to repreſent Chriſt, and his benefits; and, to confirm our intereſt in him; as alſo, to put a viſible difference between thoſe that belong unto the Church, and the reſt of the World; and, ſolemnly to engage them to the ſervice of God in Chriſt, according to his Word.</p>
               <p>II. There is in every Sacrament a ſpiritual relation, or Sacramental union, between the Sign and the Thing ſignified: whence it comes to paſs, that the Names, and effects of the one, are attributed to the other.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:113941:24"/>
               <p> III. The Grace which is exhibited in, or by the Sacraments rightly uſed, is not conferred by any power in them: neither doth the efficacy of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depend upon the Piety, or Intention of him that doth adminiſter it: but, upon the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the word of Inſtitution, which contains, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Precept authorizing the uſe thereof, a Promiſe of benefit to worthy Receivers.</p>
               <p>IV. There be only two Sacraments ordained by Chriſt our Lord, in the Goſpel; that is to ſay, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be diſpenſed by any, but by a Miniſter of the Word lawfully Ordained.</p>
               <p>V. The Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſpiritual things thereby ſignified, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, were, for ſubſtance, the ſame with thoſe of the New.</p>

               <p>BAptiſm is a Sacrament of the New Teſtament, Ordained by Jeſus Chriſt, not only for the ſolemn Admiſſion of the Party Baptized, into the Viſible Church; but alſo, to be unto him a ſigne, and ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, of his ingrafting into Chriſt, of Regeneration, of Remiſſion of ſins, and of his giving up unto God through Jeſus Chriſt, to walk in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113941:25"/> newneſs of life. Which Sacrament is, by Chriſts own appointment, to be continued in his Church until the end of the World.</p>
               <p>II. The outward Element to be uſed in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Water, wherewith the Party is to be Baptized, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, by a Miniſter of the Goſpel, lawfully called thereunto.</p>
               <p>III. Dipping of the perſon into the Water, is not neceſſary: but, Baptiſm is rightly adminiſtred, by powring, or Sprinkling water upon the Perſon.</p>
               <p>IV. Not only thoſe that do actually profeſs faith in, and obedience unto Chriſt, but alſo the Infants of one, or both beleeving Parents, are to be Baptized.</p>
               <p>V. Although it be a great Sin, to contemn, or neglect this Ordinance, yet Grace and ſalvation are not ſo inſeparably annexed unto it, as that no Perſon can be regenerated or ſaved, without it; or, that all that are Baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated.</p>
               <p>VI. The Efficacy of Baptiſm is not tyed to that moment of time, wherein it is adminiſtred; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, by the right uſe of this Ordinance, the grace promiſed, is not only offered, but really exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conferred, by the Holy Ghoſt, to ſuch (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of age, or infants) as that Grace belongeth unto, according to the Councel of Gods own Will, in his appointed time.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:113941:25"/>
               <p> VII. The Sacrament of Baptiſm is but once to be adminiſtred unto any perſon.</p>

               <p>OUr Lord Jeſus, in the night wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, Inſtituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Super, to be obſerved in his Church, unto the end of the World, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Remembrance of the ſacrifice of Himſelf, in his Death; the ſealing all benefits thereof unto true Beleevers, their Spiritual nouriſhment and growth in him, their further ingagement in, and to, all duties which they owe unto him; and, to be a bond, and pledge of their Communion with him, and with each other, as members of his myſtical Body.</p>
               <p>II. In this Sacrament Chriſt is not offered up to his Father; nor, any real Sacrifice made at all, for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins of the quick or dead; but only a Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of that one offering up of himſelf, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon the Croſs, once for all: and, a ſpiritual Oblation of all poſſible praiſe unto God, for the ſame: So that, the Popiſh Sacrifice of the Maſs (as they call it) is moſt abominably injurious to Chriſts one, only Sacrifice, the alone Propitiation for all the ſins of his Elect.</p>
               <p>III. The Lord Jeſus hath, in this Ordinance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113941:26"/> his Miniſters to declare his word of Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people; to pray, and bleſs the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to ſet them apart from a Common to an Holy Uſe; and, to Take, and Break the Bread, to Take the Cup, and (they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo themſelves) to give both to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; but, to none who are not then preſent in the Congregation.</p>
               <p>IV. Private Maſſes or receiving this Sacrament by a Prieſt or any other, alone; as likewiſe, the denial of the Cup to the people, worſhiping the Elements, the lifting them up or carrying them about for adoration, and the reſerving them for any pretended religious uſe, are all contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>V. The Outward Elements, in this Sacrament, duly ſet apart, to the uſes ordained by Chriſt, have ſuch relation to him crucified, as that, truly, yet Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally only, they are ſometimes called by the name of the things they repreſent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt; albeit, in ſubſtance and nature, they ſtill remain, truely, and only Bread and Wine, as they were before.</p>
               <p>VI. That Doctrine which maintains a change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood (commonly called Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation) by Conſecration of a Prieſt, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common Senſe and Reaſon; overthroweth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113941:26"/> the nature of the Sacrament, and hath been, and is, the cauſe of manifold Superſtitions; yea, of groſs Idolatries.</p>
               <p>VII. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the Viſible Elements, in this Sacrament, do then alſo, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but Spiritually, receive, and feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt crucified, and all benefits of his death: The Body and Blood of Chriſt being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the Bread and Wine; yet, as really, but Spiritually, preſent to the Faith of Believers in that Ordinance, as the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are to their outward ſenſes.</p>
               <p>VIII. Although ignorant, and wicked men receive the outward Elements, in this Sacrament: yet, they receive not the Thing ſignified thereby; but by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of the Lord to their own damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore, all ignorant, and ungodly perſons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with him, ſo are they unworthy of the Lords Table; and, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſin againſt Chriſt while they remain ſuch, partake of theſe Holy Myſteries, or be admitted thereunto.</p>

To theſe Officers, the Keys of the Kingdom of of Heaven are committed: by vertue whereof, they have power, reſpectively, to retain, and remit ſins; to ſhut that Kingdom againſt the impenitent, both by the Word, and Cenſures; and to open it unto penitent ſinners, by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and by Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from Cenſures, as occaſion ſhall require.</p>
               <p>III. Church Cenſures are neceſſary, for the reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and gaining of offending Brethren, for deterring of others from the like offences, for purging out of that Leaven which might infect the whole Lump, for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the honour of Chriſt, and the holy profeſſion of the Goſpel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might juſtly fall upon the Church, if they ſhould ſuffer his Covenant, and the Seals thereof to be prophaned by notorious and obſtinate offenders.</p>
               <p>IV. For the better attaining of theſe ends, the Officers of the Church are to proceed by Admonition; ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for a ſeaſon; and, by Excommunication from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113941:27"/> Church; according to the nature of the crime, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of the Perſon.</p>

               <p>FOr the better Government, and further edification of the Church, there ought to be ſuch Aſſemblies, as are commonly called Synods or Councels.</p>
               <p>II. As Magiſtrates may lawfully call a Synod of Miniſters, and other fit Perſons, to conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with, about matters of Religion; So, if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates be open Enemies to the Church, the Miniſters of Chriſt, of themſelves, by vertue of their Office; or, they, with other fit perſons, upon delegation from their Churches, may meet together in ſuch Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>III. It belongeth to Synods and Councels, miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially to determine Controverſies of Faith, and caſes of Conſcience, to ſet down Rules and Directions for the better Ordering of the publique Worſhip of God, and Government of his Church; to receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, in Caſes of Male-adminiſtration, and, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, to Determine the ſame: which Decrees, and Determinations, if conſonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence, and ſubmiſſion; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their agreement with the Word, but alſo for the Power, whereby they are made, as being an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God appointed thereunto in his Word.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:113941:28"/>
               <p> IV. All Synods or Councels, ſince the Apoſtles times, whether general, or particular, may erre; and, many have erred. Therefore, they are not to be made the Rule of Faith, or practiſe; but, to be uſed as an Help in both.</p>
               <p>V. Synods and Councels are to handle, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing, but that which is Eccleſiaſtical: and are not to intermeddle with Civil Affairs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Commonwealth; unleſs by way of humble Petition, in caſes extraordinary; or, by way of Advice, for ſatisfaction of Conſcience, if they be thereunto required by the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>

               <p>THe Bodies of men, after death, return to duſt, and ſee corruption: but, their Souls (which neither dye, nor ſleep) having an immortal ſubſiſtence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately return to God who gave them: the Souls of the Righteous, being then made perfect in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are received into the higheſt Heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full Redemption of their Bodies. And the Souls of the wicked are caſt into Hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkneſs, reſerved to the Judgement of the Great Day. Beſide theſe two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for Souls ſeparated from their bodies, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledgeth none.</p>

               <p> II. At the Laſt Day, ſuch as are found alive, ſhall not dye, but be changed: and, all the Dead ſhall be raiſed up, with the ſelf ſame bodies, and none other, although with different qualities, which ſhall be united again to their Souls for ever.</p>
               <p>III. The Bodies of the unjuſt, ſhall, by the power of Chriſt, be raiſed to diſhonour: the Bodies of the juſt by his Spirit, unto honour; and, be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his own glorious Body.</p>

               <p>GOd hath appointed a Day, wherein he will judge the World, in righteouſneſs, by Jeſus Chriſt, to whom, all Power and Judgement is given of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In which Day, not onely the Apoſtate Angels ſhall be judged, but likewiſe all Perſons that have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon Earth, ſhall appear before the Tribunal of Chriſt, to give an Account of their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds; and, to receive according to what they have done in the Body, whether good or evil.</p>
               <p>II. The End of Gods appointing this Day, is, for the manifeſtation of the Glory, of his Mercy, in the eternal ſalvation of the Elect; and, of his Juſtice, in the damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. For, then, ſhall the Righteous go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and receive that fullneſs of Joy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113941:29"/> which ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord: but, the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be caſt into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments, and be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</p>
               <p>III. As Chriſt would have us to be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, That there ſhall be a Day of Judgement, both to deter all men from Sin, and for the greater conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Godly in their Adverſity; ſo, will he have that Day unknown to men, that they may ſhake off all carnal Security, and be always watchful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not at what hour the Lord will come; and, may be ever prepared to ſay, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, Amen.</p>
